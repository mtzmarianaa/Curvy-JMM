Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm

"""

# To look for an explanation read the pdf that is in the Notizen folder.
# Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortes path in a weighted graph
# given an initial starting point.
# We're going to assume that the graph is given in two matrices (this is because
# we're tying to avoid using objects). The first matrix represents if two nodes
# are connected or not. (This in the FMM is going to be much easier hopefully). 
# So in this first graph 1 in the ij entry means that the two nodes are connected
# and 0 represents that the nodes i and j are not connected. For example,
# in the first row of such matrix, if there is a 0 in the second entry it means
# that the first node has no path to the second node. Notice that this matrix 
# doesn't have to be symmetric because such graphs are directed.
# The second graph represents the weights of the edges between the nodes.
# OBJECTIVE : USE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF LIBRARIES IN PYTHON/ALREADY PROGRAMMED FUNCTIONS

infinity = float('inf') # We need to define "infinity" and initialize the distance with this

    Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between all the nodes in a 
    grapha and the initial node (start).

       vertices : matrix that represents if two nodes are connected or not SQUARE MATRIX
       edges : matrix that represents the weights of the edges between the nodes SQUARE MATRIX AND SAME SIZE AS VERTICES
       start: an integer, in which node to start the path
    Returns:
       previous : list the node that goes before that node in the shortes path
